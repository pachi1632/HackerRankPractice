Q:

It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue from  to . Any person can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions, but they still wear their original sticker. One person can bribe at most two others.
Determine the minimum number of bribes that took place to get to a given queue order. Print the number of bribes, or, if anyone has bribed more than two people, print Too chaotic.
Example

If person  bribes person , the queue will look like this: . Only  bribe is required. Print 1.

Person  had to bribe  people to get to the current position. Print Too chaotic.
Function Description
Complete the function minimumBribes in the editor below.
minimumBribes has the following parameter(s):
int q[n]: the positions of the people after all bribes
Returns
No value is returned. Print the minimum number of bribes necessary or Too chaotic if someone has bribed more than  people.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.
Each of the next  pairs of lines are as follows:
- The first line contains an integer , the number of people in the queue
- The second line has  space-separated integers describing the final state of the queue.

Too chaotic
Explanation
Test Case 1
The initial state:
pic1(1).png
After person  moves one position ahead by bribing person :
pic2.png
Now person  moves another position ahead by bribing person :
pic3.png
And person  moves one position ahead by bribing person :
pic5.png
So the final state is  after three bribing operations.
Test Case 2
No person can bribe more than two people, yet it appears person  has done so. It is not possible to achieve the input state.

Explanation:
The "New Year Chaos" problem is a popular challenge that often appears in coding interviews and competitive programming. The premise involves a queue of people represented by numbers, where each person can "bribe" the person directly in front of them to swap positions. The goal is to determine the minimum number of bribes that took place to get to a given state, or to declare the state as too chaotic if someone has bribed more than two people.

Here's a Java solution that efficiently solves the "New Year Chaos" problem:

```java

```

### How the Solution Works:
1. **Check for Chaos**: The solution iterates backward through the queue and checks if any person is more than two positions ahead of their original position, indicating an impossible scenario (too chaotic).
2. **Count Bribes**: For each person, it counts how many times they were bribed by seeing how many people with a higher number ended up in front of them. This is done efficiently by only looking from two positions behind their original position up to their current position.
3. **Output**: The total number of bribes is printed, or "Too chaotic" if an impossible scenario is detected.

This approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently, with a time complexity that approaches O(n) in the best case and O(n^2) in the worst case, due to the nested loop that, in the worst case, iterates through a portion of the array for each element.

The technique used in the "New Year Chaos" solution can be described as a combination of **Greedy Algorithm** and **Brute Force** approaches, tailored specifically to solve this problem efficiently. Here's how these concepts apply to the solution:

### Greedy Algorithm Characteristics
- The solution iteratively checks each person in the queue to calculate the minimum number of bribes. For each person, it makes a local, greedy decision to count how many times they were bribed, based on the people currently ahead of them.
- The greedy aspect is in assuming that each person will only bribe if it benefits them to move forward and that we can count these bribes to accumulate a total minimum number of bribes.

### Brute Force Aspects
- The solution employs a brute force technique by checking, for each person, all potential bribers (people who could have bribed this person to move ahead) within a constrained range (the original position minus 2 up to the current position). This exhaustive checking ensures that no possible bribe is missed in the count.
- Although it iterates through parts of the array multiple times (nested loop), it's optimized by limiting the range of the inner loop, making it more efficient than a naive brute force approach that checks all pairs.

### Optimized Brute Force with Greedy Decision-Making
- This approach combines the exhaustive checking of brute force (within a limited range) with greedy decision-making (immediately counting bribes and declaring "Too chaotic" when a person has moved more than two places ahead).
- The optimization comes from the fact that the algorithm does not check every possible combination of bribes but instead uses the constraints (a person cannot bribe more than two ahead) to limit the search space and make immediate decisions based on local observations.

In summary, while not fitting neatly into a single algorithm category, the solution leverages principles from both greedy algorithms and brute force approaches, with optimizations to handle the specific constraints and requirements of the "New Year Chaos" problem efficiently.
